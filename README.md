### Module 2 / Lesson 1: 
Learn Regular Expression by creating a password Generator. This is part of the Scientific Computing with Python by Free Code Camp.


--------
**ABOUT:**

This lesson is divided into two different exercises. The first part, or V1, uses a 'for loop' to create a password generator. [See code here]([url](https://github.com/RazorPi/password_generator/blob/main/password_generator_v1.py))

The second version (V2) uses Regula Expressions (regex) to get the same result and make the code less verbose. 


Tips:
- The character class **\d** is a shorthand for **[0-9]**.
- The character class **\D** is a shorthand for **[^0-9]**.
- (^) [shift + 6 mac] inside of the regex means: NOT
